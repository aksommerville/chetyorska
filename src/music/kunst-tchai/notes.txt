  ok. Not too strong of rhythm. Clips with current Rabbit programs.
  
tchaikovsky_nutcracker_suite_march_71a_2_(c)kirschbaum.mid
  recognizable (sugar plum fairy?).
  Sounds simply horrid with current Rabbit programs.

tchaikovsky_nutcracker_suite_sugarplum_71a_3_(c)kirschbaum.mid
  Also recognizable, and this one was in NES Tetris too.
  Low tempo.

  Fails to decode, didn't investigate.

tchaikovsky_swan_lake_07-08_(c)lucarelli.mid
  Low tempo, clipping, not a great sound.
