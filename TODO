8x8 tiles yields a 32x18 grid.
[x] Is that big enough? 8x16 or 9x18 if we can tolerate no header or footer
  [x] What is the size of NES Tetris's playable area? 10x20
  [x] Can we handle non-power-of-two tile sizes? YES
...6x6

[x] End game
[x] Shuffle new brick low edge to y=-1
[x] Movement
[x] Rotation
[x] Line elimination
[x] Drop

[x] I've seen bricks get stuck at the top, how did that happen?
  Seems only to be immediately after clearing a line.
  ch_game_update(), I was allowing some frames to execute during the elimination blink
  
[x] dvorak-o96-1.mid: I love this song, it's perfect but the timing is screwy.
  A few seconds in, notes start appearing at +5-tick phase and they stay that way.
  [x] Is the file wrong, or am I?
    The file is wrong. It is perfectly explicit about adding this 5 tick phase shift around 0:04.503 6917 ticks
  xxx If it seems worthwhile, manually tweak this file to eliminate the shift.
    ...maybe no need, seems like we have a bunch of valid candidates.
  [x] Check other candidate files:
    * src/music/mutopia/nobm.mid: Absolutely beautiful: 0/0, 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1/3, 2/3
    * src/music/mutopia/rach-prelude23-05.mid: Similar. More 1/2 and 3/4 than nobm, and some 1/6 and 5/6 too, that's cool.
    * src/music/mutopia/rach-prelude23-09.mid: Gorgeous: Only x/4, and pretty uniform heights.
    * src/music/mutopia/dansenapolitaine.mid: Beautiful: Only x/4. Oddly, 1/2 is a little higher than 0/1.
    * src/music/mutopia/No03_Albumblatt.mid: Probly OK: 0/1, 1/2. Small but noticeable collection just north of 3/8.
    * src/music/mutopia/scriabin_etude_2_1.mid: Gorgeous: 0/1, 1/2, and a bit of 3/4
    * src/music/mutopia/Troldtog.mid: Probly OK. Almost all 0/1 and 1/2, some 1/8 1/4 3/8 3/4.
    * src/music/mutopia/turpin.mid: Beautiful: x/4 (1/2 noticeably higher than 0/1)
      src/music/mutopia/unpack/00_DvorakAmericanQuartet_Conducteur_Mvt2.mid: BAD! Most events slightly right-shifted from x/4
      src/music/mutopia/unpack/ballet.mid: Probly OK: Overwhelmingly 0/1 1/2, with some oddballs.
    * src/music/mutopia/unpack/Mvt3_Scherzo.mid: Good: Mostly 0/1, some 1/2, some worrying ~1/8
      src/music/mutopia/unpack/dvorak-o96-1.mid: BAD! Slight right-shift (see notes above)
    * src/music/mutopia/unpack/concerto-8-2.mid: Gorgeous, all x/4
    * src/music/mutopia/unpack/tuileries.mid: Gorgeous, all x/4 and mostly 0/1
    * src/music/mutopia/unpack/dvorak-o96-2.mid: Great! Much more consistent than o96-1, all 0/1 1/2 3/4
    * src/music/mutopia/unpack/dvorak-o96-3.mid: Very nice. Some triplets.
    * src/music/mutopia/unpack/anitrasdance.mid: Perfect, 0/1 and 1/2

[x] Rearrange the canonical shapes, eg the vertex of the T should always be in the same place.
  How NES Tetris does it:
   - Z: 2-cell column stays put. (remains at lowest point)
   - S: Pivots on middle-top cell in horz orientation.
   - I: Tall goes one row lower, pivots on the second tile from right.
   - L: Middle of long bar stays put.
   - L reverse: Same as L.
   *** The Ls are canonically back-up, not feet-on-the-floor as I have them.
   ...fwiw this means all except "I" are canonically two tiles tall.
   - T: Central tile stays put.
   - O: No rotation.
   
[x] Start with brick fully onscreen like NES.
  [x] Does NES have a bit of a delay when a brick appears? NO not that i can measure
  
[x] Should we nudge on rotation when blocked horizontally?
  [x] Does NES Tetris do anything like that?
  NO
  
[x] Eliminating a line way top, where the incoming brick is still partly offscreen, we discard the offscreen part.
  [x] Is this consistent with NES Tetris? Is the situation even possible there?
  This is fantastically difficult to effect, it's not worth worrying about.
  
NB: NES Tetris permits bricks to overlap any existing brick that they touch initially.
  I don't think we'll be able to pull that off without a pretty big re-think, and I don't think it's worth it.
  For us, if a brick starts overlapped, game over.

[x] MIDI In
[x] Count lines
xxx Drop score -- not convinced we need this
[x] Rhythm score
  [x] Rabbit: Add (framesperqnote) to rb_song, and (elapsedframes) to rb_song_player.
    Then a public "get_song_phase()" returning (p,c) from the synth context.
[x] Display lines and score
[x] Background music
[x] Get tempo from song
[x] Sound effects
[x] "Next brick"
[x] Initial speed, and speed advancement
  Idea: Allow the game to become technically impossible due to speed, and make that limit reachable, like 50 or 100 lines.
  The challenge is to squeeze in as many points as you can in the limited time available.
[x] Adjust music tempo according to speed?
[x] Full graphics -- fixed tile per shape?
[ ] Pause -- try to sabotage pause-as-slow-motion
[ ] MIDI per-device running status
[x] Clean up building the UI grid in game
[x] Some like "WOW!" temporary UI at each line -- show the one-line score
[ ] Likewise some per-stroke feedback re timing, the bar isn't enough.
[x] Use sprites for "next brick", center in box
[x] Restrict input to one stroke per key per frame

[x] Rabbit: Some problem with sound effects. "rotate" was silent, restarted and then it's fine (no rebuild of archive).

xxx Rabbit: Seems like events get dropped when playing at high speed.

xxx Remove Rabbit.
  If not the whole thing, at least replace its synthesizer with Beepbot.
  ...hold off on this, i'm kind of digging rabbit now
  
[x] !!! Tempo going haywire, noticed especially in song 9.
  First beat is long but i think that's to be expected.

...rb_song_player_update(): We jump player->elapsedsourceframes immediately upon consuming a DELAY event.
  That could throw the timing off.
  There's no good solution here. Actual song time elapsed is at rb_song_player_advance(), in scaled output frames.
  [x] Try diving that by tempomultiplier, but sync the source time when delay reaches zero each time.
  ...steady as a rock, hell yeah.
[x] As long as I've got this beat measurement set up, check all the songs:
  1 perfect
  2 perfect
  3 long beats (~59 at 1.2), not usable like that, and i'm not crazy about this song either, drop it. (steady as a rock tho)
  4 short beats (~19 at 1.2), steady enough
  5 perfect
  6 short beats (~17 at 1.2), apparent tempo shifts, i feel not usable. weak beat anyway.
  7 long beats (~38 at 1.2) and they trigger 1/2 out of phase, then switch. unusable
  8 beats a bit short (~23 at 1.2), love this song tho so i think it's ok. long too: 12 minutes at 1.2
  9 -- beats are consistent length now but they do seem to drift over time. like 1/2 out of phase by the end
  10 long beats (~47 at 1.2). if it's possible at all to salvage this let's do because it is just perfect musically
  11 very long beats (~71 at 1.2), also perceptually very slow at 1.2, probly not worth salvaging
  12 a hair long (~33 at 1.2) and there's a few places the tempo breaks down. i like this one so much i'm tempted to rewrite it
  13 a bit long (~35 at 1.2) and total length short (1:09 at 1.2), but nothing to complain about
  14 long beats (~44 at 1.2), some rough patches, eg right off the bat, but overall nice
  
[ ] Automated speed testing. I need to see game->fallskip in motion.
  [ ] Verify input restriction.

[x] Clean loading of music
[ ] Game over screen -- esp we want to see the score please!
[ ] Lobby
[ ] High scores
[ ] Enumerate shapes instead of generalizing (ch_game_obj.c)
[ ] Optionalize ossmidi
[ ] MacOS MIDI in
[ ] MS Windows MIDI in
[ ] Video, audio, input drivers for non-linux host (Rabbit?)
[ ] Preprocess MIDI files, remove redundant cruft. In Rabbit CLI.
  NB: The Rabbit internal song format is not stored in the archive, it will be MIDI to MIDI.
[ ] Hide cursor: Rabbit
[ ] Custom mapping of MIDI events? See ch_app_midi_note_on
[ ] At least one of these songs is abombinably slow. Not useable as is.

[x] Decent sound effects.
  Getting a line should kind of Royal Fanfare.
[x] Determine which programs are needed.
    0 Acoustic Grand Piano (6,9,10,12) (implicit: 3,4,5,7,8,11,13)
    3 Honky Tonk Piano (14)
    6 Harpsichord (2)
   40 Violin (1,2)
   45 Pizzicato Strings (1)
   47 Timpani (6)

   68 Oboe (2,6)
   70 Bassoon (6)
   71 Clarinet (6)
   73 Flute (6)
  112 Tinkle Bell (1)
[ ] Good set of songs.
  - Eliminate 6, it makes no sense.
  - 14 switches phase halfway thru. Fix that or eliminate it.
  - 12 i think does the same? tempo goes a little nuts sometimes
  - 10 i absolutely love and can't live without, but can we maybe double the tempo?

[x] What does Rabbit do when a song does not emit Program Change? eg 7(No03_Albmblatt) and 8(nobm) do not.
  Doesn't matter. They get pressed into a format with per-note program, and default to zero.

Configure MPK225 and document steps.
  Using Preset 30 "Generic".
  Desired layout, pads only:

    ...beware, the musician's scale is C..B, the A above C_2 is A_2.
    ...who let musicians name things? that's ridiculous
  OK that was easy.
  My rotate pads are backward -- is that the setup, or are they backward internally?
    COUNTER 0x2d => clock
    CLOCK   0x32 => counter
    The error is right here. Fixing initial Desired Layout.
  Hmmm this is actually a pretty nice way to play Tetris.
